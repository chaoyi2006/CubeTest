    <p>This website functions as a speedcubing timer for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube, and contains QoL features such as a scramble generator, a past solve tracker, and an ao3/ao5/ao12 calculator. The goal of this website is to allow users to passively raise money for charity through practicing speedcubing by viewing the advertisements on the website. 100% of the ad revenue generated will be donated to diabetes awareness foundations based in the US and China.</p>
